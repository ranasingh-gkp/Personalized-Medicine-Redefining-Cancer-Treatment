Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment-> Predict the effect of Genetic Variants to enable Personalized Medicine


Developed algorithms to classify genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (text).
following algorithm used.
1) Naive Bayes
2)K Nearest Neighbour Classification
3)Logistic Regression
4)Linear Support Vector Machines
5)Random Forest Classifier
6)Stack the all above models models
7) Maximum Voting classifier
Found logistic classifier worked best among all above model with 34% false prediction including stacking of all models


Performance matrix
1)Multi-class log-loss
2)Confusion matrix
